TO RUN EACH STEP:
You'll be working inside of the "step-0" directory to start.
To start the website, run the following command in your terminal:
npm run start-step-0

If we move on to the next step and you want to use my code instead to catch up, you can run the following:
Control key + C (^C) to stop the currently running process
npm run start-step-1

In this case, we stop running step-0 and start running step-1.
From here, you would start working in the "step-1" directory.
If you feel like you're caught up and don't need my code, just keep working in the "step-0" directory!
